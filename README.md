# Assessing Graph Simplification Methods for Large Gas Networks: A Metric-Based Evaluation
<h2> About</h2>
<p>
    This bachelor thesis explores methods for simplifying large-scale gas networks represented as graphs. 
    Modern gas networks consist of thousands of nodes and edges, making accurate simulation of gas flow 
    computationally intensive and costly.
</p>
<p>
    A key motivation behind this research is to <strong>reduce the size and complexity of gas network graphs</strong> 
    without sacrificing essential structural and functional characteristics. Achieving this enables 
    simulations that are faster, more cost-efficient and broadly accessible, while maintaining acceptable levels of accuracy.
</p>
<p>
    This work was conducted at the Chair of Energy and Resource Management of Technische Universität Berlin. 
    It is based on data obtained from the group's <a href="https://nemosys.de"><strong>NeMoSys Platform</strong></a>,
    a modeling environment for analyzing integrated energy networks.
</p>
<h2> Research Questions</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Which indicators need to be considered for measuring gas network simplification?</strong><br>
        → We identify and evaluate a range of structural metrics 
        that help quantify the quality of simplified network models.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>What is the effectiveness of popular graph simplification algorithms when evaluated using these criteria?</strong><br>
        → We apply well-known graph simplification techniques and assess their performance using the identified metrics 
        to understand their suitability for gas network contexts.
    </li>
</ul>
